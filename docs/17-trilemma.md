title: The Staking Trilemma
description: Diva is designed to be scalable, decentralized, and trust-minimized
---

Diva Staking was conceived to deliver the best balance between three aspects:

- Trust-minimization: Eliminating trust assumptions and the influence of humans over the protocol.
- Decentralized: Distributing operations between thousands of diversified nodes, regions, clients.
- Scalable: Able to power large amounts of staked ETH.
