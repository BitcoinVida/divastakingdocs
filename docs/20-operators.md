# Running a Diva Operator node

A node operator on the Ethereum network plays a crucial role in maintaining the network's security and stability by running an Ethereum node. Each node stores a copy of the blockchain ledger, validates transactions, and participates in the consensus process, ensuring only legitimate transactions are added to the blockchain.

**A Diva node is an augmented version of an Ethereum node** The Diva Smart contract wraps the Ethereum PoS deposit contract by providing additional functionalities, such as:

- Separation of roles between Liquid Staker (passive) and Operator (active).
- DVT-powered validation with improved performance and resiliency.
- Trust-minimized management of collateral and rewards.

Diva Operators are responsible for maintaining their node's hardware and software updates, monitoring their performance and security.

Operators are essential to the effective functioning of both the Ethereum and Diva networks, and they are rewarded for their contribution with staking rewards. [Learn more about staking with Ethereum vs with Diva](solo-staking).
