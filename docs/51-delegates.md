# Vote delegation

Participating in Diva governance can be demanding. For this reason, DIVA token holders are offered to either:

- [Select a delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva/delegates) to vote on their behalf, or
- [Self-delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva/my-voting-power) their tokens to vote directly.

**In order to become DAO members, token holders must accept their role by delegating their vote to a delegate or to themselves.**

Any transfer of tokens to a new wallet invalidates the delegation, requiring those tokens to be delegated again to be active.

## What is a Delegate?

Delegates are DAO members who represent DAO token holders by:

- Discussing and curating proposals.
- Participating on on-chain governance and voting.

These roles are crucial to participate in discussions and votes concerning the Diva Staking Protocol!

In an ideal world, every member would participate actively in governance. However, not everybody has the time or experience to review proposals. That is why [you can delegate your tokens to a delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/diva/delegates) so they may vote on your behalf. This is highly recommended for members who are less experienced or engaged.
